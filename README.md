## Description of creative portion ##
1. Forgot your password? No worries. Our news site got you covered. When you sign up as a user, you are asked two security questions. For security purposes for "security" quesitons, we hashed those answers in our database. A user can only reset/change their passwords if you can correctly answer the security questions and if and only if the username already exists in our database. By implementing this, for users who come back to our site after a while and if they forget their passwords, they can always reset their passwords, given that they remember the simple answers to security questions.

2. Like button. Creating an interactive news site will attract more audience and users. To have the ability to like the posts, it demonstrates popularity of a post and/or the author of the post. 

3. Any edge cases covered. Websites that don't go to top results google search engine are because of "bad" user experience or not safe enough. We tried to cover all the edge cases as possible so our website won't break.
